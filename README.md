# 1D_KalmanFilter

Project Name: Predicting Pedestrian position using Kalman Filter.
Team Members: Fidan Aydamirova, Radhika Magaji, Jyothish Babu
Problem Statement:
We want to predict the possible future positions of pedestrians. Predicting the motion of a group of pedestrians under vehicle influence is crucial for the development of autonomous vehicle. We want to develop a model that can describe the pedestrian’s motion under the influence of other nearby objects – vehicles and other pedestrians. 
Dataset: 
We are using the dataset collected at two crowded locations in the campus of Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in China. More information on dataset can be found here.
The trajectories of pedestrians were already extracted thru processing video frames that come from a down-facing camera mounted on a hovering drone as the recording equipment.
For the sake of simplicity, we are using 1D Kalman filter and considering only the ‘x’ position of one pedestrian.
